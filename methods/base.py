"""Common segmenter interface for every traditional method.

Contract:
  input  image : (Z, H, W) float32 in [0, 1]  -- channel 0 of the preprocessed npy;
                 air / out-of-body padding == 0 by construction.
  output mask  : (Z, H, W) bool                -- True = spleen candidate (RAW, before
                 3D post-processing / component selection, which the runner applies).

`seeds` (optional): dict with 'fg'/'bg' boolean volumes for seeded methods
(region growing, watershed, graph cuts). Intensity-only methods ignore it.

Segmenters must NEVER look at the ground truth for their prediction; the runner is
responsible for deriving oracle seeds from the GT when the oracle regime is used.
